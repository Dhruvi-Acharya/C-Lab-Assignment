program 1
In a company an employee is paid as under: Along with the basic salary, the employee would be given dearness allowance of 40% of his basic salary and house rent allowance of 20% of his basic salary. If the basic salary of an employee is received as input, write a program to find his/her gross salary.

void main()
{
    float gSalary,dAllowance,hAllownace,bSalary;
    
    printf("Enter basic salary\n");
    scanf("%f",&bSalary);
    
    gSalary = (1+0.4+0.2)*bSalary;
    
    printf("%f",gSalary);
}
